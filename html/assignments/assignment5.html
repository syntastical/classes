            Create a profile page about yourself using the CSS and HTML that we've learned in class this week.
            The content should fill at least one full screen page and not have EXCESSIVE white spaces (margins, padding).
            You must at least use the following:
            1. One or more images
            2. Three or more links
            3. One or more ordered/unordered lists
            4. One or more places with bold text
            5. One or more places with aligned text
            6. Three or more different font sizes (H1-5 tags do NOT count for this, you must use CSS)
            7. Three or more block-inline elements

            Optional:
            1. Background colors
            2. Borders
            3. Font colors

            Content ideas:
            1. Resume
            2. Page about a topic you like (game, sports, etc)
            3. Social media page
